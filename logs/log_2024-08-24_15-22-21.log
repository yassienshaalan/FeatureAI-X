Generating validation rules with gemini
Generated prompt for feature validation:
Generate a set of comprehensive data validation rules based on the following dataset statistics:
- 'age' should have values between 18 and 64.
- 'months_as_customer' should have values between 0 and 479.
- 'policy_annual_premium' should have values between 433 and 2047.
- 'comments' should only contain valid categories based on historical data.
- 'comments' should be checked for completeness, readability, sentiment, and keyword presence.
Ensure that the rules cover completeness, consistency, uniqueness, range checks, and any potential outliers. Additionally, provide guidance on detecting feature drift compared to a baseline dataset.

Generated Validation Rules for set1:
 **Data Validation Rules**

**Completeness Checks**

* All columns should contain non-null values, except for 'comments', which can be null.

**Consistency Checks**

* 'age' values should match those provided in valid customer records.
* 'months_as_customer' values should be consistent with account creation dates.
* 'policy_annual_premium' values should match those calculated based on policy type and coverage levels.

**Uniqueness Checks**

* Customer records should have unique identifiers.

**Range Checks**

* 'age' values should be between 18 and 64, inclusive.
* 'months_as_customer' values should be between 0 and 479, inclusive.
* 'policy_annual_premium' values should be between 433 and 2047, inclusive.

**Categorical Value Checks**

* 'comments' values should only contain the following categories: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, N/A.

**Specific Checks for 'comments' Field**

**Completeness:**

* 'comments' values should not be empty for customers with more than 6 months of tenure.

**Readability:**

* 'comments' values should have a Flesch Reading Ease score of 60 or higher.

**Sentiment:**

* 'comments' values should have a positive or neutral sentiment.

**Keyword Presence:**

* 'comments' values should contain at least one of the following keywords: service, support, product, value.

**Outlier Detection**

* Values outside the expected ranges for each column (e.g., age > 64) should be flagged as potential outliers.

**Feature Drift Detection**

To detect feature drift compared to a baseline dataset, the following metrics should be monitored:

* Changes in the distribution of numerical columns (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation)
* Changes in the proportions of categorical values
* Changes in the count of unique values
* Changes in the correlation between features

Generating validation rules with gemini
Generated prompt for feature validation:
Generate a set of comprehensive data validation rules based on the following dataset statistics:
- 'total_claim_amount' should have values between 100 and 114920.
- 'incident_severity' should have values between 0 and 3.
- 'age' should have values between 18 and 64.
- 'comments' should only contain valid categories based on historical data.
- 'comments' should be checked for completeness, readability, sentiment, and keyword presence.
Ensure that the rules cover completeness, consistency, uniqueness, range checks, and any potential outliers. Additionally, provide guidance on detecting feature drift compared to a baseline dataset.

Generated Validation Rules for set2:
 **Data Validation Rules**

**Completeness Checks:**
- Ensure that all required fields have values.
- Check comments field for completeness (e.g., no missing or truncated text).

**Consistency Checks:**
- Confirm that comments field does not contain invalid or nonsensical entries.
- Verify that all dates and times are consistent with the incident date.

**Uniqueness Checks:**
- Identify any duplicate claim records based on claim ID.

**Range Checks:**
- total_claim_amount: Validate that it lies between 100 and 114920.
- incident_severity: Ensure it falls within the range [0, 3].
- age: Confirm it is between 18 and 64.

**Outlier Detection:**
- total_claim_amount: Flag values significantly higher or lower than the typical range.
- age: Identify individuals who are outliers in terms of age compared to the population.

**Comments Validation:**
- **Category Validation:** Ensure comments contain valid categories based on historical data.
- **Readability Validation:** Check if comments are easily understandable using readability metrics.
- **Sentiment Validation:** Analyze comments for sentiment to identify highly negative or positive feedback.
- **Keyword Validation:** Find comments that contain specific keywords of interest.

**Feature Drift Detection**

To detect feature drift compared to a baseline dataset, follow these steps:

- **Establish Baseline Metrics:** Define statistical measures (e.g., mean, variance, distribution) for key features based on the baseline dataset.
- **Periodic Monitoring:** Regularly recalculate these metrics on the current dataset and compare them to the baseline.
- **Monitoring Thresholds:** Set thresholds for acceptable deviations from the baseline metrics.
- **Alert Monitoring:** Send alerts or notifications when thresholds are exceeded, indicating potential feature drift.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Investigate the reasons for feature drift and take corrective actions if necessary.

Generating validation rules with gemini
Generated prompt for feature validation:
Generate a set of comprehensive data validation rules based on the following dataset statistics:
- 'vehicle_claim' should have values between 70 and 79560.
- 'property_damage' should have values between 0 and 2.
- 'incident_hour_of_the_day' should have values between 0 and 23.
- 'comments' should only contain valid categories based on historical data.
- 'comments' should be checked for completeness, readability, sentiment, and keyword presence.
Ensure that the rules cover completeness, consistency, uniqueness, range checks, and any potential outliers. Additionally, provide guidance on detecting feature drift compared to a baseline dataset.
Fetching response, please wait......
Generated Validation Rules for set3:
 **Data Validation Rules**

**Completeness**

* All required fields should not be null.

**Consistency**

* 'vehicle_claim' and 'property_damage' values should align with historical observations.
* 'incident_hour_of_the_day' should be within the range of 0 to 23.
* 'comments' should be classified into valid categories.

**Uniqueness**

* There should be no duplicate records.

**Range Checks**

* 'vehicle_claim': 70 to 79560
* 'property_damage': 0 to 2

**Outlier Detection**

* Values significantly outside the expected range may be flagged as outliers.

**Comments Validation**

* **Completeness:** Check if 'comments' are present for all records.
* **Readability:** Assess readability using metrics like average sentence length and Flesch-Kincaid score.
* **Sentiment:** Analyze sentiment to identify positive, negative, or neutral comments.
* **Keyword Presence:** Check for presence of specific keywords or phrases relevant to the dataset.

**Feature Drift Detection**

* Compare dataset statistics to a baseline dataset to identify any significant changes in data distribution.
* Use statistical tests, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, to detect changes in value ranges, means, or variances.
* Monitor changes in data quality metrics over time to detect any gradual drift.
