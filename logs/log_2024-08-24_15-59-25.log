Generating validation rules with gemini
Generated prompt for feature validation:
Generate a set of comprehensive data validation rules based on the following dataset statistics:
- 'age' should have values between 18 and 64.
- 'months_as_customer' should have values between 0 and 479.
- 'policy_annual_premium' should have values between 433 and 2047.
- 'comments' should only contain valid categories based on historical data.
- 'comments' should be checked for completeness, readability, sentiment, and keyword presence.
Ensure that the rules cover completeness, consistency, uniqueness, range checks, and any potential outliers. Additionally, provide guidance on detecting feature drift compared to a baseline dataset.

Generated Validation Rules for set1:
 **Data Validation Rules**

**Completeness**

* Ensure that no fields have missing values.

**Consistency**

* Check for duplicate records based on unique identifiers (e.g., customer ID).

**Uniqueness**

* Ensure that unique identifiers (e.g., customer ID) are actually unique.

**Range Checks**

* Validate that 'age' falls between 18 and 64.
* Validate that 'months_as_customer' falls between 0 and 479.
* Validate that 'policy_annual_premium' falls between 433 and 2047.

**Domain Checks**

* Verify that 'comments' contains only valid categories based on historical data.

**Text Quality Checks**

* Check 'comments' for completeness, readability, sentiment, and keyword presence.

**Outlier Detection**

* Identify any values that significantly deviate from the expected range or distribution.
* For example, 'age' values below 18 or above 64 could be considered outliers.

**Feature Drift Detection**

* Compare the current dataset statistics to a baseline dataset.
* Identify any significant changes in the distribution or statistics of features over time, which could indicate feature drift.

**Additional Guidance**

* Use automated tools to streamline data validation processes.
* Perform regular data quality audits to ensure ongoing compliance with validation rules.
* Involve subject matter experts to provide insights and ensure the accuracy of domain-specific checks.
* Establish data quality monitoring processes to proactively detect and address data quality issues.

Generating validation rules with gemini
Generated prompt for feature validation:
Generate a set of comprehensive data validation rules based on the following dataset statistics:
- 'total_claim_amount' should have values between 100 and 114920.
- 'incident_severity' should have values between 0 and 3.
- 'age' should have values between 18 and 64.
- 'comments' should only contain valid categories based on historical data.
- 'comments' should be checked for completeness, readability, sentiment, and keyword presence.
Ensure that the rules cover completeness, consistency, uniqueness, range checks, and any potential outliers. Additionally, provide guidance on detecting feature drift compared to a baseline dataset.

Generated Validation Rules for set2:
 ## Data Validation Rules

### Completeness

- Check for null or missing values in all columns.

### Consistency

- Ensure that the following column pairs have the expected relationships:
    - 'total_claim_amount' and 'incident_severity': More severe incidents typically result in higher claim amounts.
    - 'age' and 'incident_severity': Younger individuals may be involved in more severe incidents.

### Uniqueness

- Check for duplicate rows based on unique identifiers (e.g., claim ID, patient ID).

### Range Checks

- Validate that values fall within the specified ranges:
    - 'total_claim_amount': [100, 114920]
    - 'incident_severity': [0, 3]
    - 'age': [18, 64]

### Outlier Detection

- Identify potential outliers for 'total_claim_amount' and 'incident_severity' based on statistical measures (e.g., interquartile range).

### Category Validation for 'comments'

- Create a controlled vocabulary based on historical data to validate categories in the 'comments' column.
- Check for misspelled or invalid categories.

### Text Quality Validation for 'comments'

- Assess completeness: Check for comments with minimal or no content.
- Evaluate readability: Use metrics like Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level to ensure comments are understandable.
- Analyze sentiment: Identify comments expressing positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
- Search for keywords: Extract relevant keywords from comments to understand key themes.

## Feature Drift Detection

- Establish a baseline dataset with known characteristics.
- Periodically compare the current dataset with the baseline using statistical tests (e.g., t-test, chi-square test) to detect changes in data distribution.
- Monitor changes in key variables (e.g., 'total_claim_amount', 'incident_severity') and text features ('comments') to identify potential drifts.

Validating feature set 'set3'...
Generating validation rules with gemini
Generated prompt for feature validation:
Generate a set of comprehensive data validation rules based on the following dataset statistics:
- 'vehicle_claim' should have values between 70 and 79560.
- 'property_damage' should have values between 0 and 2.
- 'incident_hour_of_the_day' should have values between 0 and 23.
- 'comments' should only contain valid categories based on historical data.
- 'comments' should be checked for completeness, readability, sentiment, and keyword presence.
Ensure that the rules cover completeness, consistency, uniqueness, range checks, and any potential outliers. Additionally, provide guidance on detecting feature drift compared to a baseline dataset.
Fetching response, please wait......
Generated Validation Rules for set3:
 **Completeness**

- All required fields must be populated with valid data.
- 'vehicle_claim', 'property_damage', and 'incident_hour_of_the_day' should not be null.
- 'comments' should not be empty.

**Consistency**

- 'vehicle_claim' should match the provided insurance claim amount.
- 'property_damage' should match the reported level of damage to property.
- 'incident_hour_of_the_day' should match the time of the incident as recorded in the police report.
- 'comments' should match the incident summary provided by the claimant.

**Uniqueness**

- Each observation should have a unique identifier.

**Range Checks**

- 'vehicle_claim' should have values between 70 and 79560.
- 'property_damage' should have values between 0 and 2.
- 'incident_hour_of_the_day' should have values between 0 and 23.

**Outliers**

- 'vehicle_claim' values outside the range of 70 to 79560 should be flagged for review.
- 'property_damage' values outside the range of 0 to 2 should be flagged for review.
- 'incident_hour_of_the_day' values outside the range of 0 to 23 should be flagged for review.

**Comments Validation**

- 'comments' should only contain valid categories based on historical data.
- 'comments' should be checked for completeness, readability, sentiment, and keyword presence.

**Feature Drift Detection**

- Monitor the following metrics over time to detect feature drift:
    - Number of missing values
    - Distribution of values for each field
    - Frequency of valid categories in 'comments'
    - Minimum, maximum, and mean values of 'vehicle_claim', 'property_damage', and 'incident_hour_of_the_day'
- Compare these metrics to a baseline dataset to identify potential shifts in data quality.
