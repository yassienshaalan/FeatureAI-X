Generating validation rules with gemini
Generated prompt for feature validation:
Generate a set of comprehensive data validation rules based on the following dataset statistics:
- 'age' should have values between 18 and 64.
- 'months_as_customer' should have values between 0 and 479.
- 'policy_annual_premium' should have values between 433 and 2047.
- 'comments' should only contain valid categories based on historical data.
- 'comments' should be checked for completeness, readability, sentiment, and keyword presence.
Ensure that the rules cover completeness, consistency, uniqueness, range checks, and any potential outliers. Additionally, provide guidance on detecting feature drift compared to a baseline dataset.

Generated Validation Rules for set1:
 ## Data Validation Rules

**Completeness**

* All rows should have a value for all columns.

**Consistency**

* 'age' values should match the chronological age of the customer.
* 'months_as_customer' should be consistent with the customer's account creation date.
* 'policy_annual_premium' should be consistent with the policy type and coverage details.
* 'comments' should align with the corresponding customer's history and feedback.

**Uniqueness**

* 'age' should be unique for each customer.
* 'months_as_customer' should be unique for each customer.
* 'policy_annual_premium' should be unique for each customer's policy.

**Range Checks**

* 'age' should be between 18 and 64.
* 'months_as_customer' should be between 0 and 479.
* 'policy_annual_premium' should be between 433 and 2047.

**Outliers**

* Values that fall outside the defined ranges should be flagged as outliers.
* Customers with extreme values in 'age' or 'months_as_customer' should be reviewed.

**'comments' Category Check**

* 'comments' should be assigned to valid categories based on historical data.
* Valid categories might include: positive feedback, negative feedback, product suggestions, etc.

**'comments' Quality Check**

* 'comments' should be checked for completeness (e.g., no missing words or phrases).
* 'comments' should be readable and well-written.
* 'comments' should be checked for sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
* 'comments' should be checked for presence of relevant keywords.

## Feature Drift Detection

To detect feature drift compared to a baseline dataset:

* Use statistical tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) to compare the distributions of features in the new dataset to the baseline.
* Calculate metrics such as mean, standard deviation, and variance to identify significant changes.
* Monitor the frequency of invalid values or outliers.
* Review 'comments' for changes in sentiment or keyword presence.

Generating validation rules with gemini
Generated prompt for feature validation:
Generate a set of comprehensive data validation rules based on the following dataset statistics:
- 'total_claim_amount' should have values between 100 and 114920.
- 'incident_severity' should have values between 0 and 3.
- 'age' should have values between 18 and 64.
- 'comments' should only contain valid categories based on historical data.
- 'comments' should be checked for completeness, readability, sentiment, and keyword presence.
Ensure that the rules cover completeness, consistency, uniqueness, range checks, and any potential outliers. Additionally, provide guidance on detecting feature drift compared to a baseline dataset.
Fetching response, please wait......
Generated Validation Rules for set2:
 **Data Validation Rules**

**Completeness**
- Ensure that all required fields have non-null or non-empty values.

**Consistency**
- Verify that 'total_claim_amount' is within the expected range (100-114920).
- Check that 'incident_severity' only takes values between 0 and 3.
- Confirm that 'age' falls within the specified range (18-64).

**Uniqueness**
- Identify any duplicate claims based on unique identifiers (if available).

**Range Checks**
- Validate that 'total_claim_amount' is positive.
- Ensure that 'age' is within the acceptable range (18-64).

**Categorical Validation**
- Restrict 'comments' to authorized categories based on historical data.

**NLP-Based Validation (for 'comments')**
- **Completeness:** Check for empty or missing comments.
- **Readability:** Analyze readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid index) to ensure ease of understanding.
- **Sentiment:** Determine if the comments convey positive or negative sentiment.
- **Keyword Presence:** Identify the presence of specific keywords or phrases that may indicate fraud or other issues.

**Anomaly Detection (Outlier Handling)**
- Set thresholds for extreme values of 'total_claim_amount' and investigate any outliers that fall outside of these limits.
- Monitor changes in the distribution of 'incident_severity' over time to detect any significant deviations.

**Feature Drift Detection**
- Compare the statistics of the current dataset to a baseline dataset.
- Track changes in variable distributions, means, and variances to identify any shifts.
- Implement drift detection algorithms to monitor for significant changes that may impact model accuracy.

Generating validation rules with gemini
Generated prompt for feature validation:
Generate a set of comprehensive data validation rules based on the following dataset statistics:
- 'vehicle_claim' should have values between 70 and 79560.
- 'property_damage' should have values between 0 and 2.
- 'incident_hour_of_the_day' should have values between 0 and 23.
- 'comments' should only contain valid categories based on historical data.
- 'comments' should be checked for completeness, readability, sentiment, and keyword presence.
Ensure that the rules cover completeness, consistency, uniqueness, range checks, and any potential outliers. Additionally, provide guidance on detecting feature drift compared to a baseline dataset.

Generated Validation Rules for set3:
 **Completeness Rules:**

- All required fields must be populated.
- 'comments' should be complete and not null.

**Consistency Rules:**

- 'vehicle_claim' and 'property_damage' should be consistent with each other.
- 'incident_hour_of_the_day' should be consistent with the time of day.
- 'comments' should be consistent with the nature of the claim.

**Uniqueness Rules:**

- 'incident_id' should be unique.

**Range Checks:**

- 'vehicle_claim' should be between 70 and 79560.
- 'property_damage' should be between 0 and 2.
- 'incident_hour_of_the_day' should be between 0 and 23.

**Outlier Detection:**

- Identify values that are significantly higher or lower than the expected range.
- Monitor extreme values in 'vehicle_claim' and 'property_damage'.

**'Comments' Validation Rules:**

- **Category Validation:** Verify that 'comments' include values from a predefined list of valid categories.
- **Completeness:** Check if 'comments' are empty or contain insufficient detail.
- **Readability:** Check for readability score using readability formulas.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determine the sentiment of 'comments' (positive, neutral, or negative).
- **Keyword Presence:** Identify the presence of specific keywords in 'comments' for relevance.

**Feature Drift Detection:**

- Compare the distribution of features in the current dataset to a baseline dataset.
- Identify any significant shifts in the mean, variance, or shape of the data.
- Monitor changes in the distribution of 'comments' over time.
