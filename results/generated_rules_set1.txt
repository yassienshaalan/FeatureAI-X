**Data Validation Rules**

**Completeness**

* Ensure that no fields have missing values.

**Consistency**

* Check for duplicate records based on unique identifiers (e.g., customer ID).

**Uniqueness**

* Ensure that unique identifiers (e.g., customer ID) are actually unique.

**Range Checks**

* Validate that 'age' falls between 18 and 64.
* Validate that 'months_as_customer' falls between 0 and 479.
* Validate that 'policy_annual_premium' falls between 433 and 2047.

**Domain Checks**

* Verify that 'comments' contains only valid categories based on historical data.

**Text Quality Checks**

* Check 'comments' for completeness, readability, sentiment, and keyword presence.

**Outlier Detection**

* Identify any values that significantly deviate from the expected range or distribution.
* For example, 'age' values below 18 or above 64 could be considered outliers.

**Feature Drift Detection**

* Compare the current dataset statistics to a baseline dataset.
* Identify any significant changes in the distribution or statistics of features over time, which could indicate feature drift.

**Additional Guidance**

* Use automated tools to streamline data validation processes.
* Perform regular data quality audits to ensure ongoing compliance with validation rules.
* Involve subject matter experts to provide insights and ensure the accuracy of domain-specific checks.
* Establish data quality monitoring processes to proactively detect and address data quality issues.
