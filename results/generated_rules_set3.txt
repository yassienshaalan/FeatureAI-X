**Completeness**

- All required fields must be populated with valid data.
- 'vehicle_claim', 'property_damage', and 'incident_hour_of_the_day' should not be null.
- 'comments' should not be empty.

**Consistency**

- 'vehicle_claim' should match the provided insurance claim amount.
- 'property_damage' should match the reported level of damage to property.
- 'incident_hour_of_the_day' should match the time of the incident as recorded in the police report.
- 'comments' should match the incident summary provided by the claimant.

**Uniqueness**

- Each observation should have a unique identifier.

**Range Checks**

- 'vehicle_claim' should have values between 70 and 79560.
- 'property_damage' should have values between 0 and 2.
- 'incident_hour_of_the_day' should have values between 0 and 23.

**Outliers**

- 'vehicle_claim' values outside the range of 70 to 79560 should be flagged for review.
- 'property_damage' values outside the range of 0 to 2 should be flagged for review.
- 'incident_hour_of_the_day' values outside the range of 0 to 23 should be flagged for review.

**Comments Validation**

- 'comments' should only contain valid categories based on historical data.
- 'comments' should be checked for completeness, readability, sentiment, and keyword presence.

**Feature Drift Detection**

- Monitor the following metrics over time to detect feature drift:
    - Number of missing values
    - Distribution of values for each field
    - Frequency of valid categories in 'comments'
    - Minimum, maximum, and mean values of 'vehicle_claim', 'property_damage', and 'incident_hour_of_the_day'
- Compare these metrics to a baseline dataset to identify potential shifts in data quality.
